            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>A digital ghost in the machine, navigating the neon-lit alleys of the web. I craft experiences, build worlds, and hack the future. My work exists at the intersection of bleeding-edge technology and dystopian aesthetics, exploring themes of identity, control, and rebellion in the digital age.</p>
            <p>Fluent in multiple code-streams, I specialize in creating immersive digital environments, AI-driven narratives, and secure communication protocols for those who operate in the shadows. My philosophy is simple: the future is not found, it is forged. And I am one of its many architects.</p>
            <p>In my downtime, I delve into retro-futuristic simulations, analyze pre-collapse data archives, and occasionally interface with rogue AIs for philosophical debates. The line between human and machine blurs with every passing cycle, and I am here to document its evolution.</p>

                    <h3>Project Beta: GhostNet Protocol</h3>
                    <p>Decentralized data haven for the digital underground. GhostNet utilizes a multi-layered encryption and peer-to-peer routing system to ensure anonymous and untraceable communication and data storage, resistant to corporate and state-level surveillance.</p>

            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>To initiate contact, send an encrypted data packet to the following address: <a href="mailto:malibutt0404@gmail.com">malibutt0404@gmail.com</a>. Standard comm channels are monitored; exercise caution. Alternatively, leave a dead drop message on the Nexus-7 data shard, sector Gamma-9. Response time may vary depending on solar flare activity and system integrity.</p>
            <p>For urgent matters, broadcast a signal on the old emergency frequency 47.77 MHz. Authenticate with the passphrase "Neon Rain." Remember, in this city, information is power, and discretion is survival.</p>
